# examples folder for crypter

## order of reading
`test.pdf` turned into `e-test.pdf.txt` turned into `d-e-test.pdf`. Notice how `test.pdf` and `d-e-test.pdf` are exactly the same, showing the successful decryption. Also notice that `e-test.pdf.txt` is total nonsense.

## terminal interactions
`encryption_example.png` shows the process of turning `test.pdf` into `e-test.pdf.txt`. Similarly, `decryption_example.png` shows the process of turning `e-test.pdf.txt` into `d-e-test.pdf`. 

## terminal help options
`all_help_messages.png` shows all the possible help messages that are in the program. You can always see a help message by replying 0 to a question asked. (Therefore you cannot have your password be 0 -- 0 is a bad password). In between the help messages a file `testing.txt` is encrypted.
